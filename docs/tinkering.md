# BitBoxBase: Tinkering

For **advanced users**, full root access and the possibility to validate and customize the BitBoxBase configuration is a must. This section explains how to work with the device on a operating-system level. Be aware that you could easily break stuff and might not be able to recover the factory settings easily.

For information how to change the configuration of the BitBoxBase, see the section [Operating system / Configuration](../os/configuration.md).
