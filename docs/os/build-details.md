## Armbian build details

This document goes into more detail on how the Armbian build process works.

The [`armbian/build.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/build.sh) script is the entrypoint to the Armbian build process. When running `make` in the `armbian/` directory, it in turn invokes the `armbian/build.sh` script under the hood.

It performs the following steps:

1. cloning the [`github.com/armbian/build`](https://github.com/armbian/build/) repo into `armbian/armbian-build/`, if it doesn't exist already
1. copying over the following files from the host system into `armbian/armbian-build/userpatches/overlay/`:
    1. `armbian/base/`: scripts and configs included in the Armbian image
    1. `build/`: contains all built Go binaries and their associated `.service` files
    1. [`customize-image.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/build/customize-image.sh): the hook which the Armbian build process calls
1. constructing the appropriate build arguments
1. calling the [`armbian/armbian-build/compile.sh`](https://github.com/armbian/build/blob/master/compile.sh) script with the `docker` argument, to kick off the dockerized build process

During the Armbian build process that's started by [`compile.sh`](https://github.com/armbian/build/blob/master/compile.sh), our [`customize-image.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/build/customize-image.sh) script is eventually called inside the build container, at which point it copies over scripts and configs from the overlay directory into the Armbian filesystem, and it in turn calls our [`customize-armbian-rockpro64.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/build/customize-armbian-rockpro64.sh) script.

Finally, the [`customize-armbian-rockpro64.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/build/customize-armbian-rockpro64.sh) script handles steps like:
1. creating users/groups to runthe different services
1. configuring SSH keys
1. installing runtime dependencies
1. creating and enabling systemd `.service` files
1. writing miscellaneous configs
