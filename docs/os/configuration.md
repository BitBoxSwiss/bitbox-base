## Configuration

It's important to keep the BitBoxBase in a consistently configured state.
Here we describe how to set the initial configuration on build, control it internally during operations, store and backup the configuration and manage it remotely from the BitBox App.

### Initial configuration on build

The initial system configuration is set on build and can be altered by setting build options in the file [`armbian/base/build.conf`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/build.conf).

Available options are described directly in the file and are set to default values.
A few examples of build options you can set:

* `BASE_BITCOIN_NETWORK`: set to `mainnet` or `testnet`
* `BASE_HOSTNAME`: set it to `alice` and your BitBoxBase will be visible as `alice.local` within your network
* `BASE_AUTOSETUP_SSD`: set to "true" to automatically initialize the SSD on first boot
* `BASE_OVERLAYROOT`: set to 'true' to make the root filesystem read-only
* ...and many more.

To preserve a local configuration, you can copy the file to `build-local.conf` in the same directory. This file is excluded from Git source control and overwrites options from `build.conf`.

### *bbb-config.sh*: manage configuration during operations

System configuration is managed internally using the script [`bbb-config.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/scripts/bbb-config.sh).
Its goal is to centrally define how changes are applied to the system and reuse a single set of commands.
This is why it is called by the build script as well as by the BitBoxBase Middleware during operations.
Changes are applied by simple operating system commands like copying and deleting files, or replacing text values withing configuration files.

You can call the script `bbb-config.sh --help` to see all possible commands and arguments:

```
BitBoxBase: system configuration utility
usage: bbb-config.sh [--version] [--help]
                     <command> [<args>]

assumes Redis database running to be used with 'redis-cli'

possible commands:
  enable    <bitcoin_incoming|bitcoin_ibd|bitcoin_ibd_clearnet|dashboard_hdmi|
             dashboard_web|wifi|autosetup_ssd|tor|tor_bbbmiddleware|tor_ssh|
             tor_electrum|overlayroot|sshpwlogin|rootlogin|unsigned_updates>

  disable   any 'enable' argument

  set       <hostname|loginpw|wifi_ssid|wifi_pw>
            bitcoin_network         <mainnet|testnet>
            bitcoin_dbcache         int (MB)
            other arguments         string
```

### *bbb-cmd.sh*: execution of standard commands

Similar to the configuration script, the [`bbb-cmd.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/scripts/bbb-cmd.sh) script acts as the central repository for standard commands, to be called from the Middleware.

```
BitBoxBase: system commands repository
usage: bbb-cmd.sh [--version] [--help] <command>

possible commands:
  setup         <datadir>
  base          <restart|shutdown>
  bitcoind      <reindex|resync|refresh_rpcauth>
  flashdrive    <check|mount|umount>
  backup        <sysconfig|hsm_secret>
  restore       <sysconfig|hsm_secret>
  mender-update <install|commit>
```

### *Redis*: storage of configuration values

The [Redis](https://redis.io/) key/value datastore is used to manage configuration data.
It can be queried from all software components, be it from the command line, Bash, Python or Go with minimal overhead.

* from the terminal, Redis can be used with its command-line utility [`redis-cli`](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli)
* for usage within bash scripts, the necessary helper function are sourced from the include [redis.sh.inc](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/scripts/include/redis.sh.inc)
* Go applications use the [Redigo](https://github.com/gomodule/redigo) client
* Python uses [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py)

During build, the factory settings are imported from [`armbian/base/config/redis/factorysettings.txt`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/config/redis/factorysettings.txt) using the [Redis mass insertion protocol](https://redis.io/topics/mass-insert) using the helper script [`armbian/base/scripts/redis-pipe.sh`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/scripts/redis-pipe.sh).

The Redis data is dumped frequently and on demand to `/data/redis/bitboxbase.rdb`, from where it can be backed up or restored.

Configuration values are stored in keys, like the following examples. For a full reference of used keys, refer to [`factorysettings.txt`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/config/redis/factorysettings.txt).

```
base:hostname         bitbox-base
tor:base:enabled      1
bitcoind:network      mainnet
lightningd:bind-addr  127.0.0.1:9735
electrs:db_dir        /mnt/ssd/electrs/db
```

### *bbbconfgen*: Updating of configuration files

Configuration files are created dynamically using [`bbbconfgen`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/tree/master/tools/bbbconfgen), with the templates located in [`armbian/base/config/templates/`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/tree/master/armbian/base/config/templates):

This application parses a template, populates it with the corresponding Redis values, and stores it to the system (even into the read-only filesystem, if applicable).

* during build, the bash function `generateConfig()` is used within the Armbian customizing script.
* in regular operation, changes to Redis values and the regeneration of config files are typically executed through the `bbb-config.sh` or `bbb-cmd.sh` scripts.

To keep the configuration scripts consistent, the bash function `generateConfig()` is sourced from the include file [`generateConfig.sh.inc`](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-base/blob/master/armbian/base/scripts/include/generateConfig.sh.inc).

### *BitBox App*: user interface

Ultimately, the configuration is managed by the user through the BitBox App, that talks to the Middleware which in turn calls either the `bbb-config.sh` or `bbb-cmd.sh` script with the necessary arguments.

The App provides a convenient backup feature to save the whole system configuration directly to a USB stick plugged into the Base.
