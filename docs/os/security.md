## Security considerations

As a networked device, reachable from the outside, the attack surface of the BitBox Base needs to be minimized as much as possible. This is why we decided not to provide a web interface and expose only one API port by default.

### Pairing Base with BitBox App
The BitBox App functions as the user interface for the BitBox Base. At first, the Base announces itself on the local network and the Middlware exposes provides an API endpoint to initiate a secure connection, which can be automatically detected by the App, 

and only after the Base is securely paired with the BitBox App


### No web interface



### Reverse proxy



### Firewall



### Brute-force protection



### SSH Keys



### Local vulnerabilities
* locked root user
