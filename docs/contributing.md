# Contributing

The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests".
This facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

  1. Fork repository
  1. Create topic branch
  1. Commit patches
  1. Push changes to your fork
  1. Create pull request

In general [commits should be atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention) and diffs should be easy to read.
For this reason do not mix any formatting fixes or code moves with actual code changes in the same commit.

Commit messages should be verbose by default consisting of a short subject line (50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separate
paragraph(s), unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like "Corrected typo in Makefile") in which case a single title line is sufficient.
Commit messages should be helpful to people reading your code in the future, so explain the reasoning for your decisions.
Further explanation [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

If a particular commit references another issue, please add the reference. For example: `refs #1234` or `fixes #4321`.

Please refer to the [Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more information about Git.

If a pull request is not to be considered for merging (yet), please prefix the title with [WIP] or use [Tasks Lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#task-lists) in the body of the pull request to indicate tasks are pending.

The body of the pull request should contain enough description about what the patch does together with any justification/reasoning.
You should include references to any discussions (for example other tickets or chat/mail discussions).

At this stage one should expect comments and review from other contributors.
You can add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushing to your fork until you have satisfied all feedback.
