# BitBoxBase: User interface

Our goal is to create a seamless experience with no technical setup.
We are using the free and open-source BitBoxApp to manage the Base.
This allows us to provide:

* automatic discovery of the BitBoxBase
* secure pairing and fully encrypted communication
* interactive setup wizard over a secure channel
* direct integration of the fully-validating Bitcoin full node into the BitBoxApp
* an integrated Lightning wallet in the BitBoxApp
* reliable connectivity between App and Base over multiple networking channels
* a reduced attack surface of the BitBoxBase by not running a web server

The BitBoxApp is maintained in its own GitHub repository: [https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-wallet-app](digitalbitbox/bitbox-wallet-app)
