# BitBox Base: User Interface

Our goal is to create a seamless experience with no technical setup. We are using the free and open-source BitBox App to manage the Base. This allows us to provide:

* automatic discovery of the BitBox Base
* secure pairing and fully encrypted communication
* interactive setup wizard over a secure channel
* direct integration of the fully-validating Bitcoin full node into the BitBox App
* an integrated Lightning wallet in the BitBox App
* reliable connectivity between App and Base over multiple networking channels
* a reduced attack surface of the BitBox Base by not running a web server

The BitBox App is maintained in its own GitHub repository: [https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-wallet-app](digitalbitbox/bitbox-wallet-app)
